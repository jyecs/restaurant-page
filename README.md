# restaurant-page

I didn't actually do this assignment as much as I just wanted to know how to get the webpack setup, I might do something later
in order to setup a template so I don't have to do as much work just to get things up and running.

Honestly the project didn't really appeal to me that much especially since it was so wordy to get through and I'm so close
to that react module. I'll probably skip the CS module apart from some reading since I already have a lot of experience
with that type of stuff.
